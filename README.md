This repository hosts a comprehensive implementation of a Machine Learning Classification Problem using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from the sklearn library. The goal of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of five supervised learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)—in predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The dataset is first preprocessed by checking for missing values, ensuring there are no duplicates, and splitting it into training and testing sets. Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler to standardize the data, which is crucial for algorithms like SVM and k-NN that are sensitive to feature magnitudes. Each model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and classification report. The results reveal that Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM achieve the highest accuracy of 98.25%, while Decision Tree and k-NN perform slightly lower. A bar plot is included to visually compare the accuracy of the models, making it easy to identify the best-performing algorithms. The code is thoroughly documented with explanations for each step, ensuring clarity and reproducibility. This project not only demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset but also provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different classification algorithms
